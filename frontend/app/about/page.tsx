          By 2016, we began to see the fruits of our labor as word spread about
          our work, leading us to our first major client â€” a regional retail
          chain. This was a pivotal moment for us, as it allowed us to hire our
          first employee. Emma stepped up to lead user experience design, while
          Liam and I focused on coding and project management.

          As we gathered to reflect on our incredible journey, hosting a
          community event to showcase local tech talent felt like the perfect
          way to give back and inspire the next generation of innovators. It
          reminded us that with passion, collaboration, and a bit of code,
          anything is possible.
